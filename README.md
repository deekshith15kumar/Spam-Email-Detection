This project is a machine learning-based email classifier that predicts whether a given email is spam or not spam. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from email text and applies supervised learning algorithms to perform accurate classification. The goal is to automate the process of spam detection, which plays a crucial role in enhancing email security and user experience. The system is developed using various technologies such as Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn for backend processing, and HTML and CSS for the basic user interface.

The model was trained using a labeled dataset of spam and non-spam emails. After preprocessing and vectorizing the data, the Random Forest Classifier was applied, achieving an accuracy of approximately 97%. This high level of performance indicates the model's strong capability in identifying spam emails effectively. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning and NLP in solving real-world problems and offers a foundation for further development, such as deploying the model in real-time applications or integrating it with email clients.
